# Landing Page

This is a landing page project that demonstrates a responsive layout with a dynamic navigation menu and smooth scrolling functionality.

## Usage

To use this landing page, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Dependencies

No external dependencies are required. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Design

The landing page consists of four sections, each with its own content. The navigation menu is dynamically generated based on the sections. When a section is in the viewport, it is highlighted in the navigation menu. Clicking on a navigation item smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section. The fixed navigation bar hides when not scrolling and reappears after a certain idle period. There is also a "Scroll to Top" button that becomes visible when scrolling below the fold of the page.

## Additional Features

- Active state added to navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
- Fixed navigation bar hides while not scrolling.
- Scroll to top button visible when scrolling below the fold of the page.
- Sections can be made collapsible.
